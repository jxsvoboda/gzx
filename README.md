GZX - George's ZX Spectrum Emulator
===================================
Copyright (c) 1999-2017 Jiri Svoboda

Introduction
------------
GZX is a ZX Spectrum emulator. I wrote it at a time where Linux had no
good emulators and it's been the only emulator I used ever since.
It still needs a lot of polishing - some of the more advanced features
are difficult to use by a non-developer and the source code is a bit
messy. But it is nevertheless usable.

Software compatibility is a bit lacking. (This is due to bugs that need
fixing, we do support some rather advanced/undocumented CPU features).

Some of the features of this emulator:

  * Run in Windows (DirectDraw or GDI) and Linux (SDL 1.x)
  * ZX Spectrum 48K, 128K
  * AY-3-8192
  * Z80, SNA, AY snapshots
  * Read TAP, TZX, WAV tape formats
  * Write TAP
  * High vertical resolution, Spec256 (experimental)
  * Emulate built-in MIDI port of 128K Spectrum
  * Record data sent to I/O ports
  * Built-in debugger

To get the latest source
------------------------

    $ hg clone https://bitbucket.org/jiri_svoboda/gzx/ gzx/trunk
    $ cd gzx/trunk

Compiling
---------

You need a working GNU toolchain (GCC, Binutils, Make) (Linux or similar OS)
and SDL 1.2 development package. To build Windows binaries, you need MingW64
cross-compiler.

To build just the 'gzx' binary

    $ make

To build all binaries, including Windows binaries:

    $ make all

Cross-compiling for HelenOS
---------------------------

You need a built HelenOS workspace and a working cross-compiler toolchain.
If you don't have one, you need to do something like

    $ git clone https://github.com/HelenOS/helenos.git helenos
    $ cd helenos
    $ sudo tools/toolchain.sh amd64
    $ make PROFILE=amd64

You may need to have some development packages installed. For details,
see http://www.helenos.org/wiki/UsersGuide/CompilingFromSource

Next you need to setup XCW tools which we use for the cross-compilation:
    $ PATH=$PATH:$PWD/tools/xcw/bin

Now go to your gzx workspace and off we go:
    $ cd ../gzx
    $ make test-hos

This will build the HelenOS binaries, install then to the HelenOS workspace
and start emulation. Once in HelenOS start GZX by typing

    # cd gzx
    # ./gzx

If you want to only build the binaries without installing, type
    $ make hos

If you want to only build and install the binaries without starting emulation,
type
    $ make install-hos

Now you need to go to root of your HelenOS workspace and type 'make' to re-build
the OS image.
